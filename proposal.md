# Video Processor

## Repository
<https://github.com/Supervi803/FinalProject.git>

## Description
The program will take in user's video and show the fps, duration, and resultion of it and have the option to change those properties. My program is relevant because it is used by people for media and digital art purposes.  

## Features
- Showing Video Information
	- After receiving the video input by the user, the program will output the FPS (Frames Per Second), Duration, and Resolution of the video. 
- Edit Video Option
	- After the user receives the information about their inputed video, they have the option to change those properties. 
- Gif Progress Representation and Images (Optional)
	- Shows progress running through a gif. 

## Challenges
- I need to learn how to find the properties of a video. 
- I need to learn how to change the properties of a video (mainly the frame rate and the duration). 
- I need to learn how to program a save video file to the user's files. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome would be an easy-to-read window with buttons that enable the user to easily edit their video's FPS, Duration, and Resolution, and save it to their files. The window would also have cute UI and funny progress bars or gifs. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essentials are to run the program, which will receive video in the file folder, and have editing options for FPS, Duration, and Resolution. It will then save a new video in the src folder.
